üìù Project Overview

This project focuses on Breast Cancer Diagnosis using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to classify tumors as Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) using machine learning.

The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and converting diagnosis labels to numerical values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions, correlations, and class balance to understand patterns in the data.

Model Training: Applying Logistic Regression on standardized features to predict tumor type.

Evaluation: Using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve (AUC) to measure model performance.

The model achieved high accuracy and AUC, demonstrating its potential as a reliable tool to support early breast cancer diagnosis and decision making.

‚ö° How to Run / Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-folder>

Open in Google Colab:
Open Breast_Cancer_Classification.ipynb in Google Colab.

Upload Dataset:
Download the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from Kaggle.
Upload the .zip or data.csv file when prompted in Colab.

Run the Notebook:
Execute the notebook cells sequentially to clean data, train the model, and generate visualizations.

Output:
Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC Curve (AUC).
